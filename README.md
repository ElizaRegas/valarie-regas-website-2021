# Getting Started with the React.js Template

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

1. Create an empty, public GitHub repository, without any addons, such as README.

2. Create a new React app in the terminal:

$ npx create-react-app {your repo name}

3. Check the information in the package.json for name, homepage, etc.

4. Install package.json dependencies.

5. $ git init

6. $ git remote add origin https://github.com/{username}/{repo name}.git

7. $ npm run deploy
